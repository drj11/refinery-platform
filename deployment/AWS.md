# Deployment on Amazon AWS

Generate AWS Cloud Formation template file using `cfn-pyplates`
and create stack using AWS cli tools.
`awscli` and `cfn-pyplates` should already be
in `requirements.txt`
so you should already have installed all of that.

## AWS account requirements

- The AWS must have a key pair with KeyName `id_rsa`.
- SSH access only works if the default security group allows
  inbound access on port 22 (the SSH port).
- HTTP access only works in the default security group allows
  inbound access on port 80.

## Generate JSON file and start stack:

```
cfn_py_generate template.py deploy.json &&
aws cloudformation create-stack --stack-name test-$(date +%Y%m%dT%H%M) --template-body file://deploy.json
```

This creates a stack with a new name every time, you might
prefer to re-use the stack name and delete it when you want to
create a new stack.
